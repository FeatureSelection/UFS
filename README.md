# UFS

Teun's branch.

To run the experiment, change the files in scikit-feature as stated in the changed_files folder.
In that folder you also find the directories of the files so it's easier to implement. 
Note: it is easiest to first change the files and then install scikit-feature through the 
command 'python setup.py install'. 

After that, download the datasets available in the google drive and put them in the data folder. 
The data folder can be found in the experiment_files folder. 

The requirements are available in the requirements.txt file. 
A docker container can be made with these requirements.
